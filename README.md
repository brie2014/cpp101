# Overview

This repo housese two projects that can be completed to learn basic C++. C++ is an object-oriented program (OOP) language. It is commonly used for application and embedded development and is based off of the C language. It has a wide range of features, and is cross platform compatible. Learning the basics of C++ will allow you to master many fundamental programming principles that can be easily transferred when learning other languages.

This project contains 2 subprojects that demonstrate different principles and elements of C++, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, data structure, and inheritance.

- Project 1: Hello World
- Project 2: Games Console App (Tic Tac Toe and Hangman)

**Requirements**

- [x] Variables
- [x] Expressions
- [x] Conditionals
- [x] Loops
- [x] Functions
- [x] Classes
- [x] Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map)
- [x] Stretch Goal: demonstrate inheritance with virtual functions.

# Future Work

- Add more game options
- Add a GUI for the games (rather than just console based)
- Get actual projects setup (rather than individual files) and run in Visual Studio
